# Variational Sampler for Diffusion Bridges

This repository contains an implementation of a variational sampler adapter from this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04391) for diffusion bridges. The sampler is used to sampler from [I2SB](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.05872)

## Installation

Using anaconda create an env from the conda.yaml

```bash
conda env create -f conda.yaml
```

experiments can then be run with:
```bash
python experiment.py
```
